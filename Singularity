Name        Metis1
Description A remake of Metis that participated in IPC2014. It uses partial order reduction (simple stubborn sets) with a safety belt that turns off pruning if not enough pruning happens and with support for conditional effects, symmetry-based pruning (OSS), the h2 preprocessor of Alc√°zar and Torralba, and the lmcut heuristic with support for conditional effects.
